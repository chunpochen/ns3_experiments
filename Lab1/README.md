### Objective
The primary aim of this experiment is to demonstrate how to set up a basic network topology in NS-3 and how to configure and run a UDP echo application for simple data transmission.

### Network Design

- **Topology Structure:** The topology consists of one server node (n0) and multiple client nodes (n1-n5), connected through point-to-point links.
- **Server Node:** The server node is equipped with a UDP echo server application.
- **Client Nodes:** The client nodes run a UDP echo client application, sending data packets to the server and receiving echo responses.
